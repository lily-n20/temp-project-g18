## A/B Testing

### A/B Test Name:
NPS Score Enhancement through UI Redesign

### User Story Number:
US002

### Metric (from the HEART grid):
Net Promoter Score (NPS)

### Hypothesis:
We believe that the current placement and design of our NPS survey are leading to low response rates and potentially lower scores. By redesigning the user interface to make the NPS survey more engaging and accessible post-interaction, we expect to see an increase in response rates and overall NPS.

### Experiment:
- **Audience**: All users post-interaction, with 50% exposed to the current NPS survey (control) and 50% exposed to the redesigned NPS survey (variant).
- **Duration**: 3 weeks to gather enough data to analyze.
- **Success Metrics**: Increase in NPS response rate and an improvement in the overall NPS score.
- **Tracking Setup**: Utilize Firebase Analytics to track the number of survey prompts shown, the number of responses received, and the respective scores. Compare these between the control and variant groups.

### Variations:
- **Control Version**: The current NPS survey design and placement.
- **Test Version**: A redesigned NPS survey with improved visibility and user engagement features, such as an interactive slider for rating, more colorful design, and a motivational message post-completion.

### Design Mockups:
- Include mockups for both the control and test versions, showing the changes in UI design and placement within the app.

## A/B Test Name:
Adoption Software Framework Optimization

### User Story Number:
US002

### Metric (from the HEART grid):
Adoption

### Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the current adoption rate of our software is hindered by complex onboarding processes, resulting in user drop-off. By simplifying the initial setup experience with a guided tour featuring interactive tooltips, we anticipate an increase in user adoption.

### Experiment:
- **Audience**: All new users will be divided into two groups: 50% exposed to the current onboarding process (control group) and 50% exposed to the optimized onboarding flow (experimental group).
- **Duration**: The experiment will run for four weeks to observe the impact on adoption rates.
- **Success Metrics**: Success will be measured by observing the increase in user adoption rates and a reduction in drop-off rates during the onboarding process.
- **Tracking Setup**: Firebase Analytics will be employed to track user interactions during the onboarding process. Metrics tracked will include completion rates for each onboarding step, time spent on each step, and engagement with the guided tour elements.
- 
### Variations:
- **Control Version**:
Users experience the current onboarding process without any guided tour or interactive tooltips.

- **Test Version**:
Users are guided through the onboarding process with a tour featuring interactive tooltips providing explanations and guidance for each step.

### Design Mockups:
Include mockups for both the control and test versions, highlighting the differences in the onboarding flow and showcasing the introduction of interactive tooltips in the test version for improved user guidance and engagement.

## A/B Test Name:
Daily Active Users (DAU) Increase through Onboarding Flow Optimization

### User Story Number:
US003

### Metric (from the HEART grid):
Daily Active Users (DAU)

### Hypothesis:
We believe that the current onboarding flow is leading to a high dropout rate among new users, resulting in lower daily active user counts. By optimizing the onboarding experience to be more intuitive and engaging, we expect to see an increase in the number of daily active users.

### Experiment:
- **Audience**: All new users, with 50% exposed to the current onboarding flow (control) and 50% exposed to the optimized onboarding flow (variant).
- **Duration**: 4 weeks to observe the impact on daily active user counts.
- **Success Metrics**: Increase in daily active user counts and a decrease in the dropout rate during the onboarding process.
- **Tracking Setup**: Utilize Mixpanel to track the number of users completing the onboarding flow, the time spent on the platform post-onboarding, and the daily active user counts. Compare these metrics between the control and variant groups.

### Variations:
- Control Version: The current onboarding flow with multiple screens and lengthy instructions.
- Test Version: An optimized onboarding flow with streamlined steps, interactive tutorials, and personalized recommendations.
### Design Mockups:
Include mockups for both the control and test versions, illustrating the differences in the onboarding flow and highlighting the changes in UI design and user interaction.
