## Decision Making Process

Decisions within our community will be made through a consensus-based approach. We value the input and perspectives of all members and strive to reach agreements that are acceptable to everyone.

## Attendance Expectations

We expect all members to attend meetings regularly and actively participate in community activities. If a member is unable to attend a meeting, they should notify the group in advance and provide a legitimate reason for their absence. To make up for missed meetings, members are encouraged to review meeting minutes and contribute their thoughts and ideas asynchronously.

## Assignments and Accountability

Assignments will be distributed based on member availability, skills, and interests. In the event that a member fails to complete or poorly completes an assignment, the group will address the issue through open communication and provide support and guidance to help the member improve their performance.

## Ensuring Full Participation

NO PHONE!!!

We value the full participation of every member in our community. To ensure inclusivity, we will establish clear communication channels and encourage active engagement from all members. We will also recognize and honor individual strengths and interests, allowing members to contribute in areas where they excel.

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums

Meeting times and locations/mediums will be decided through a collaborative process that takes into account the availability and preferences of all members. We will strive to find a balance that accommodates everyone's schedules and ensures equal access to meetings. We have agreed to meet in our scheduled project section on Mondays, as well as Wednesdays in a zoom format.

Current Meeting Time: Wednesdays @ 5:00 PM via. Zoom

## Agenda, Minutes, and Notes

During meetings, designated individuals will take minutes/notes to capture important discussions, decisions, and action items. These minutes/notes will be shared with all members in a timely manner, ensuring transparency and accountability within the community.

## Promptness

We expect all members to be prompt for meetings and community activities. If a member anticipates being late, they should notify the group in advance and provide an estimated time of arrival. Lateness should be minimized to ensure efficient use of everyone's time.

## Conversational Courtesies

To encourage active listening and respectful dialogue, we will promote conversational courtesies within the team. This includes giving each member the opportunity to speak, actively listening to others' perspectives, avoiding interruptions, and staying on topic during discussions. Tangents should be kept to a minimum to maintain focus.

## Enforcement/Feedback

The team will enforce its own rules through open communication and mutual accountability. If a member is not adhering to the conduct guidelines, the issue will be addressed through respectful feedback and discussion. We will strive to provide feedback in a constructive manner, taking into consideration individual preferences for giving and receiving feedback.
